# Code-Competitions
So I like to do a lot of coding competitions online, so I thought I'd post the code I write up here.

Anything from a current competitions will not be posted here until after the site permits.

Keep in mind that over time I do not plan to go back and improve this code. That means that code from when this started may not be the "best" approach, rather it may show how I have changed over time.

Websites I use currently are:
www.hackerrank.com
www.codechef.com
www.hackerearth.com
